DESCRIPTION
-----------
This archive contains an ISO C++ class implementing arbitrary length arrays
of bits.  The class is intended to be easy to follow and expand upon,
though it may be used without an understanding of its implementation.

FILES
-----
bitarray.cpp    - Class providing operations on arbitrary length arrays
                  of bits.
bitarray.h      - Header for bitarray class.
sample.cpp      - Program demonstrating how to use the bitarray class. 
LICENSE         - GNU Lesser General Public License
Makefile        - makefile for this project (assumes gcc compiler and GNU make)
README          - this file

BUILDING
--------
To build these files with GNU make and gcc, simply enter "make" from the
command line.

USAGE
-----
sample.cpp demonstrates usage of each of the bitarray functions.

HISTORY
-------
08/03/04 - Initial release

TODO
----
- Test on platforms with character lengths other than 8 bits.
- Consider implementing overloads that return cont bit_array_c
